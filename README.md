  ## Summary/Introduction

  <summary>Product Proposal</summary>
  <hr>
  My employer is part of Associated British Foods plc, which is multi-national business with operations in 56 countries around the world (ABF, 2024). With colleagues in mutliple timezones, planning meetings with consideration and convenience can be challenging. My product proposal is for an easy to use application where users can set a location, date, and time, then select a second location, and the application will give the equivalent date and time for the secondary location.

  <summary>Development Approach</summary>
  <hr>

  ## Development Approach
  
The development approach of this project will be itterative and agile, with an expectation of three sprints. A significant component of this product is the user interface (UI), an itterative agile approach allows for the testing of useable software and UI at earlier stages in the software development lifecycle, and results from this can lead to changes in development (Ferreira, Noble and Biddle, 2007).

  <summary>Low-Fidelity Plan and Moodboard</summary>
  <hr>

## Low-Fidelity Plan
A low-fidelity flow for the application was prototyped using Figma and is available at [Figma.com](https://www.figma.com/proto/kTpbqRqdkA15Keu1uF1nJs/Summative-1?node-id=1-2&t=BiJiPwSoCtLmuO3u-1/).

  <br>

A welcome screen will provide the user with some basic information about the application, and will feature some appropriate imagry and branding.
The user can start using the functionality of the application, or quit. As this is a web-based applicaiton, quitting will take them to the ABF homepage.

## Moodboard

To aid decision making regarding colour schemes and design choices, I created a moodboard. This was made up from screen snippets of solid colours snapped from abf.co.uk, I then identified the HEX and RGB values of these colours for easy reference when it comes to formatting the visuals of the applicaiton. A list of CSS web safe fonts was obtained from w3schools.com (2024), these were added to the moodboard and Verdana was chosen for the application font as it is stylistically complementary to the font used for the Associated British Foods plc name. An AI generated image of the globe was created using Microsoft Designer (n.d.) as it is free to use and avoids any licensing issues.

## Project Management Tools

  The project management tool used is GitHub Projects. The Iterative Project Planning template was selected so that the iterations and sprints can be clearly shown and managed. There are three planned iterations:

  1) <b>Iteration 01</b><br>
     09 December 2024 - 15 December 2024<br>
     <b>Goal:</b> Produce a basic framework for the app, showing very basic functionality. 
      
  2) <b>Iteration 02</b><br>
     16 December 2024 - 20 December 2024<br>
     <b>Goal:</b> Aquire user feedback, add visualisation, testing.
  
  3) <b>Iteration 03</b><br>
     21 December 2024 - 04 January 2025<br>
     <b>Goal:</b> Aquire user feedback, testing.      

  <br>
