  <summary>Product Proposal</summary>
  <hr>
  My employer is part of Associated British Foods plc, which is multi-national business with operations in 56 countries around the world (ABF, 2024). With colleagues in mutliple timezones, planning meetings with consideration and convenience can be challenging. My product proposal is for an easy to use application where users can set a location, date, and time, then select a second location, and the application will give the equivalent date and time for the secondary location.

  <summary>Development Approach</summary>
  <hr>
The development approach of this project will be itterative and agile, with an expectation of two to three sprints. A significant component of this product is the user interface (UI), an itterative agile approach allows for the testing of useable software and UI at earlier stages in the software development lifecycle, and results from this can lead to changes in development (Ferreira, Noble and Biddle, 2007).

  <summary>Design with Figma</summary>
  <hr>
  
A low-fidelity flow for the application was prototyped using Figma and is available at [Figma.com](https://www.figma.com/proto/kTpbqRqdkA15Keu1uF1nJs/Summative-1?node-id=1-2&t=BiJiPwSoCtLmuO3u-1/).

  <br>

A welcome screen will provide the user with some basic information about the application, and will feature some appropriate imagry and branding.
The user can start using the functionality of the application, or quit. As this is a web-based applicaiton, quitting will take them to the ABF homepage.
